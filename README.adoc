Title: Debugging PHP

Repository: php-debugging
Type of Challenge: Learning challenge
Duration: 1 day
Team challenge : solo
Learning objectives
understanding the root of bug fixing
know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
know what to do the next time you're stuck
give yourself the solver's mentality, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!
The Mission
Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language.
Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them and
they find a way to fix it every time! I scoured the internet for a debugging guide,
that I felt like I could get behind and here it is: The guide

This is what I feel like doing when coding PHP that doesn't mean that this should be your way.
Discover, look up, research whatever ways work for you to debug you code!

I very much encourage you to use xDebug as much as possible!

Must-have features
Open up the junior.php.broken file, read the comments, fix the code blocks as
requested in the comments and put the final file expert.php in the repository folder as requested.

You will change this junior code in expert code!

## TO DO
- [x] find explanation Xdebug on YouTube
- [x] exercise 1: initialize x in the function
- [x] exercise 2: array starts at [0]
- [x] exercise 3: debug could not start because of wrong "".
- [x] exercise 4: missing & in foreach, this code is not recommended to use.
If you use it ,you may not forget to unset the reference
(https://coderwall.com/p/qx3fpa/php-foreach-pass-by-reference-do-it-right-or-better-not-at-all)
- [x] exercise 5: the for loops keeps on going, also when only '< z' -> I adapted the length
- [x] exercise 6:
1. missing & in foreach (function combineNames)
2. the length of the array is 11 but the counting starts at 0 -> count -1
3. implode function first separator, then array (implode(separator, $array))

4. randomHeroName and combineNames (echo) don't return something -> change echo into return
- [x] exercise 7: copyright(): Argument #1 ($year) must be of type int, string given -> deleted int in function,
echo replaced by print_r
-Â´[x]exercise 8:
1. return is the end of a function, 2 x return is not possible
2. the name AND the password needs te be correct -> change or (||) into and (&&).
- [x]exercise 9:
1. strpos() returns FALSE if the token was not found and the (first) position of the token in string if it was found.
You need to check for boolean FALSE using the strict comparison operator === to identify if a token was found in a string or not
2. To show the result, add echo before calling the function.
- [x]exercise 10:
* unset changes the count of the array -> put number out of the function
